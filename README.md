## 사용의도

## 스케쥴 목적 달성 

- [x] `Google Domain` 의 DNS를 이용한 Git-hub `Pages` IP 전환 + Https 적용 후 보안 활성화.
- [x] `React` `Jest` 를 이용한 테스트 코드(CICD) 작성.
- [x] Git-hub `Action` 을 이용한 원격저장소 컨텐츠 변경 후 리액트 빌드 및 자동 배포 활성화. 
- [x] `.gitignore` 을 이용한 멀티 플랫폼에서의 접근성 용이하도록 제외 추가하였음. 

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
