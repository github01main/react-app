            <p>Indie Game Director and Design and Development I'm shiwook jo from south korea, and i do content on Design an Development. 
               I really enjoy learning languages and New software Development frameworks like Django and Javascript, as well as work in Hive-mind studio. 
               The planning and design of the project was mainly done. And I used to blender as a sub-skill. and developed an indie game with the blueprint of Unreal Engine based on C++ for 5 years. 
               People ask me. Why do you always find difficult things, solve them, and show them?. as i say that's my milestone.</p>
